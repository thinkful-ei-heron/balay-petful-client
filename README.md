Here at FIFO Pet Rescue we take a different approach to the adoption process. Instead of picking a specific pet you would like to adopt, we pair you with a pet based on a FIFO (First in, first out) system. Each pet gets adopted in the order they came to our rescue and each adoptee gets paired with a pet in that same order. Here at FIFO Pet Rescue we believe that adopting a pet shouldn't be about the breed, age, or size - it should be about saving a life.
